Introduction
This document outlines the JavaScript code for a simple implementation of the popular card game. The code utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with some audio files) to create a functional game interface and logic.

Components
HTML Structure: The HTML file provides the structure for the game interface, including elements for player scores, buttons for actions (hit, stand, deal), card display areas for the player and dealer, and an area to display game commands.

CSS Styling:

CSS styles the HTML elements to create a visually appealing game interface.

JavaScript Functions:

Initialization:

The Cardgame object initializes game parameters such as player scores, cards, and wins/losses/draws.

Drawing a Card:

The drawCard function randomly selects a card from the deck, updates the player's score, displays the drawn card, and plays a sound effect.

Updating Score: 

The updateScore function calculates the player's score based on the drawn card and updates it accordingly.

Showing Score:

The showScore function displays the player's current score in the designated score span.

Computing Winner: 

The findwinner function determines the winner of the round based on the player and dealer scores.

Displaying Results:

The showresults function updates the game command area to show whether the player won, lost, or drew, and plays corresponding sound effects.

Scoreboard Update:

The scoreboard function updates the scoreboard with the current wins, losses, and draws.

Hit Button Functionality:

The BJhit function handles the hit button's functionality, allowing the player to draw cards until they stand or bust.

Deal Button Functionality:

The BJdeal function resets the game state, allowing the player to start a new round.

Stand Button Functionality: The BJstand function handles the stand button's functionality, allowing the dealer to draw cards until they reach a score of 16 or higher, 

then determines the winner.

How the Game Works


Initialization: The game initializes with the player and dealer having a score of 0 and the deck containing all 52 cards.

Gameplay:

Hit: The player can draw cards by clicking the hit button. They can continue to draw cards until they stand or their score exceeds 21 (bust).

Stand: The player can choose to stand, indicating they are satisfied with their current hand. The dealer then draws cards until their score is 16 or higher.

Determining the Winner:
If the player's score is less than or equal to 21 and is higher than the dealer's score or the dealer busts, the player wins.
If the player and dealer have the same score, it's a draw.
If the player's score exceeds 21 or is lower than the dealer's score, the player loses.

End of Round:


After determining the winner, the game displays the result, updates the scoreboard, and allows the player to start a new round by clicking the deal button.
Conclusion
This JavaScript code creates a functional card game with basic gameplay mechanics, including drawing cards, determining the winner, and updating the scoreboard. The game provides an interactive and enjoyable experience for players.
